The bottom of this file contains a postscript that describes the problem in the execution of the training as reflected in the output from a full run of the notebook.

1. Part 7 - Loading Image Data (Exercises).ipynb

Work-in-progress file for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree, Part 6. Neural Networks, Lesson 4: Deep Learning with PyTorch, Concept 20. Loading Image Data, Optional TODO: Attempt to build a network to classify cats vs dogs from this dataset.

My method using grayscale versions of the input image data executed without error on the training dataset training process, but produced an error in the validation dataset model forward pass. Pradeep correctly pointed out that I neglected to flatten my images for the validation steps. I corrected this error in the corresponding Udacity notebook workspace's Jupyter notebook.
