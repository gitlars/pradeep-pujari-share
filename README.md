My method using grayscale versions of the input image data executed without error on the training dataset training process, but produced an error in the validation dataset model forward pass. Pradeep correctly pointed out that I neglected to flatten my images for the validation steps. I corrected this error in the corresponding Udacity notebook workspace's Jupyter notebook.
